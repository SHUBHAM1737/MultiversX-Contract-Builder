## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- MetaMask Browser Extension
- MNT Tokens for deployment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/SHUBHAM1737/MultiversX-Contract-Builder.git
cd MultiversX-Contract-Builder


2. Install dependencies
bash
npm install


3. Run the development server
bash
npm run dev


4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## 🔐 Environment Configuration

Create a .env file in the project root with the following key configurations:

bash
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# MultiversX Blockchain Configuration
MULTIVERSX_RPC_ENDPOINT=https://api.multiversx.com



*Important:*
- Never commit the .env file to version control
- Add .env to your .gitignore
- Provide actual API keys and credentials
- Keep your sensitive information confidential
